# MosaicJSON 0.0.3

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# 1. Purpose

This specification attempts to create a standard for representing
metadata about a mosaic of Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files.

# 2. File format

MosaicJSON is intentionally based on the TileJSON specification and uses
the JSON format.

# 3. Structure

The following describes the structure of a MosaicJSON object. Implementations MUST treat unknown keys as if they weren't present. However, implementations MUST expose unknown key value pairs so users can optionally handle these keys. Implementations MUST treat invalid values for keys as if they werenâ€™t present. If the key is optional and the value is invalid, the default value MAY be applied. If the key is required, implementations MUST treat the entire MosaicJSON manifest file as invalid and refuse operation.

The word "implementation" in the following sections refers to services or tools that serve, generate, or validate MosaicJSON objects.

Ref: https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/blob/master/3.0.0/README.md#3-structure


## 3.1 `mosaicjson`

REQUIRED. String.

A semver.org style version number. Describes the version of the MosaicJSON spec that is implemented by this JSON object.

```JSON
{
  "mosaicjson": "0.0.3"
}
```

## 3.2 `name`

OPTIONAL. String. Default: null.

A name describing the mosaic. The name can contain any legal character. Implementations SHOULD NOT interpret the name as HTML

```JSON
{
  "name": "compositing"
}
```

## 3.3 `description`

OPTIONAL. String. Default: null.

A text description of the mosaic. The description can contain any legal character. Implementations SHOULD NOT interpret the description as HTML.

```JSON
{
  "description": "A simple, light grey world."
}
```

## 3.4 `version`

OPTIONAL. String. Default: "1.0.0".

A [semver.org](https://semver.org/) style version number of the tiles. When changes across tiles are introduced the minor version MUST change. This may lead to cut off labels. Therefore, implementors can decide to clean their cache when the minor version changes. Changes to the patch level MUST only have changes to tiles that are contained within one tile. When tiles change significantly, such as updating a vector tile layer name, the major version MUST be increased. Implementations MUST NOT use tiles with different major versions.

```JSON
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 3.5 `attribution`

OPTIONAL. String. Default: "1.0.0".

Contains an attribution to be displayed when the map is shown to a user. Implementations MAY decide to treat this as HTML or literal text. For security reasons, make absolutely sure that this content can't be abused as a vector for XSS or beacon tracking.

```JSON
{
  "attribution": "<a href='http://openstreetmap.org'>OSM contributors</a>"
}
```

## 3.6 `minzoom`

REQUIRED. Integer.

An integer specifying the minimum zoom level.

```JSON
{
  "minzoom": 0
}
```

## 3.7 `maxzoom`

REQUIRED. Integer.

An integer specifying the maximum zoom level. MUST be >= `minzoom`.

```JSON
{
  "maxzoom": 11
}
```

## 3.8 `quadkey_zoom`

OPTIONAL. Integer. MUST be =< maxzoom

The zoom value for the quadkey index. If `quadkey_zoom` is > `minzoom`, then on each tile request from zoom between `minzoom` and `quadkey_zoom`, the tiler will merge each quadkey asset lists.

The use of `quadkey_zoom` can be beneficial when dealing with a high number of files and a large area.

```JSON
{
  "quadkey_zoom": 0
}
```

## 3.9 `bounds`

OPTIONAL. Array. Default: [-180, -90, 180, 90].

The maximum extent of the mosaic. Bounds MUST define an area covered by all zoom levels. The bounds are represented in WGS 84 latitude and longitude values, in the order left, bottom, right, top. Values may be integers or floating point numbers.

```JSON
{
  "bounds": [ -180, -85.05112877980659, 180, 85.0511287798066 ]
}
```

## 3.10 `center`

OPTIONAL. Array. Default: null.

The first value is the longitude, the second is latitude (both in WGS 84 values), the third value is the zoom level as an integer. Longitude and latitude MUST be within the specified bounds. The zoom level MUST be between minzoom and maxzoom. Implementations MAY use this center value to set the default location. If the value is null, implementations MAY use their own algorithm for determining a default location.

```JSON
{
  "bounds": [ -76.275329586789, 39.153492567373, 8 ]
}
```

## 3.11 `tiles`

REQUIRED. Object.

A dictionary of per quadkey assets in form of `{quadkeys: [asset]}` pairs. Keys MUST be valid quadkeys index with zoom level equal to mosaic `minzoom` (or `quadkey_zoom` if present).

Values MUST be arrays of strings (url or sceneid) pointing to an asset with bounds intersecting with the quadkey bounds.

```JSON
{
  "tiles": {
    "030130": [
      "file1.tif",
      "file2.tif",
    ]
  }
}
```

## 3.12 `asset_type`

OPTIONAL. String.

A string describing the type of the asset found in `tiles`.

```JSON
{
  "asset_type": "COG"
}
```

## 3.13 `asset_prefix`

OPTIONAL. String.

A string describing the prefix to add to the `asset` string.

```JSON
{
  "asset_prefix": "http://hostname.io/cog/"
}
```

## 3.14 `data_type`

OPTIONAL. String.

Asset's datatype info.

One of:
- `int8`: 8-bit integer
- `int16`: 16-bit integer
- `int32`: 32-bit integer
- `int64`: 64-bit integer
- `uint8`: unsigned 8-bit integer (common for 8-bit RGB PNG's)
- `uint16`: unsigned 16-bit integer
- `uint32`: unsigned 32-bit integer
- `uint64`: unsigned 64-bit integer
- `float16`: 16-bit float
- `float32`: 32-bit float
- `float64`: 64-big float
- `cint16`: 16-bit complex integer
- `cint32`: 32-bit complex integer
- `cfloat32`: 32-bit complex float
- `cfloat64`: 64-bit complex float
- `other`: Other data type than the ones listed above (e.g. boolean, string, higher precision numbers)

```JSON
{
  "data_type": "uint8"
}
```

## 3.15 `colormap`

OPTIONAL. Object.

GDAL like colormap in form of `{key: [r, g, b, a], ...}`.

```JSON
{
  "colormap": {
    0: [0, 0, 0, 0],
    ...,
    255: [1, 1, 1, 255]
  }
}
```

## 3.16 `tilematrixset`

OPTIONAL. Object.

TileMatrixSet used for the `quadkey` definition. The TMS document should be compliant with the OGC TMS 2.0 specification (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/2D-Tile-Matrix-Set/master/schemas/tms/2.0/json/tileMatrixSet.json)
